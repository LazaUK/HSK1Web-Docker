# HSK1Web-Docker
Back in 2003 I studied HarvardX' amazing course - CS50 at edX. I've recently founded my PHP+MySQL Web project that I built for CS50's final assessment. So, decided to containerise it now. And make it available for those interested in preparation for their Mandarin Chinese HSK1 exam.
