# Dockeried version of HSK1 Web solution, to test your readiness for the Mandarin Chinese exam

Back in 2013 I studied HarvardX' amazing course - CS50 (https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) at edX. It was great intro to the basics of computer science, taught by charismatic David J. Malan.

I've recently founded my CS50's final assessment project, which uses PHP and MySQL. After 6 years, it's still functional :-). But these days you don't need to setup your own LAMP server: there are ready to use Docker images. So, in the spirit of DevOps, I've decided to containerise my old project.

And make it available to those interested in preparation for their Mandarin Chinese HSK1 exam. Enjoy and good luck with your exam !!
